**      **Code work :

**	**•**	**Scalability Stress Test: Run MATILDA on a dataset with >1 million tuples to substantiate our “at scale” claim.

**	**•**	**Heuristic Implementation: Add/document path-searching heuristics in the constraint graph to move beyond the current naive search (the other mining approaches I did for the phd manuscript).

**	**•**	**Sensitivity Analysis ($N$): Run tests varying recursion depth $N$ and report the trade-off between runtime and pattern coverage.

**	**•**	**Precision/Recall: Compare results against ground truth (e.g., known Foreign Keys/Inclusion Dependencies) (on the rules).**  **-> almost done** **

**	**•**	**SOTA Update: Include comparisons with at least one more recent TGD/rule mining baseline (AnyBurl?). —> done integré** **

**	**•**	**Statistical Analysis: Add mean/standard deviation and significance tests to all performance results (re-run global X5)
